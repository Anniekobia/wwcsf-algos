# Trees and Graphs

This is a more advanced topic that builds especially on [Linked Lists](https://github.com/WomenWhoCode/wwcsf-algos/blob/master/topics/linked-lists.md). We recommend that you get comfortable with Linked Lists before tackling trees and graphs.

## Resources

### 1. Basics and terminology
* [Harvard CS50 2019 Data Structures lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IrUAqYKjIA&t=4104s) You can skip ahead to 1:09:32 for trees, but I recommend watching the lecture from the beginning. The language is C, but the explanation and examples don't depend on a knowledge of C. 
* Helpful list of terms and definitions from wikiversity: https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/Trees_and_Graphs
* Chapter links from __Algorithms__ by Jeff Erickson.  
     * [Basic Graph Algorithm](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/book/05-graphs.pdf)  
     * [Depth-First Search](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/book/06-dfs.pdf)  
     * [Minimum Spanning Trees](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/book/07-mst.pdf)  
     * [Shortest Paths](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/book/08-sssp.pdf)          
             
    
    
### 2. Important procedures: traversal, heaps, search, etc.
* [William Fiset's youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDV1Zeh2NRsDGO4--qE8yH72HFL1Km93P) explaining graph theory topics and algorithms. Not language specific.  
    * [William Fiset's implementations in Java](https://github.com/williamfiset/Algorithms/tree/master/src/main/java/com/williamfiset/algorithms/graphtheory)
* [Trees](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/Trees/toctree.html) and [Graphs](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/pythonds/Graphs/toctree.html) from _Python DS_ by Brad Miller and David Ranum, code examples in Python
* [Binary Search Trees](http://greenteapress.com/thinkdast/html/thinkdast014.html) from _Think Data Structures_  by Allen B. Downey, code examples in Java
* [Breadth-First Search](https://livebook.manning.com/book/grokking-algorithms/chapter-6/4) from _Grokking Algorithms_ by Aditya Y. Bhargava, code examples in Python

### 3. Special topics
* Dijkstra's algorithm to find the Single-Source Shortest Path
    * [Chapter 7](https://livebook.manning.com/book/grokking-algorithms/chapter-7/1) from _Grokking Algorithms_ by  Aditya Y. Bhargava
    * [Single-Source Shortest Paths](https://visualgo.net/en/sssp?slide=1) explorations from visualgo.net

* Spanning trees and forests
    * [Wikipedia : Minimum Spanning Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree)
