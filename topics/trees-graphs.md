## Resources
Time to brush up on trees! Here are some resources. 
Definitions and terminology:
Harvard's CS50 lecture on data structures. You can skip ahead to 1:09:32 for trees, but I recommend watching the lecture from the beginning. The language is C, but the explanation and examples don't depend on a knowledge of C. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IrUAqYKjIA&t=4104s
Helpful list of terms and definitions from wikiversity: https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms/Trees_and_Graphs
    
Important procedures: traversal, heaps, search, etc.:
