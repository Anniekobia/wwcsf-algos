## Resources 
* [Recursion on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/recursive-algorithms/a/recursion): A great resource for a refresher on recursion, suitable for members at all levels of coding.
* [Chapter 3. Recursion](https://livebook.manning.com/book/grokking-algorithms/chapter-3/37) from _Grokking Algorithms_ by Aditya Y. Bhargava: Contains visual examples of recursion. Code examples in Python. 
* Java: [Recursive methods](http://greenteapress.com/thinkjava6/html/thinkjava6006.html#sec64) from _Think Data Structures_ by Allen B. Downey
* Python: [Conditionals and Recursion](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython006.html#toc59) from _Think Python_ by Allen B. Downey
* [Stanford CS106b handout](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1176/handouts/midterm/5-BigO.pdf): This handout walks through how to big - O complexity for loops and recursion.
* [VisuoAlgo Recursion Tree](https://visualgo.net/en/recursion?slide=1): Visualizes the recursive calls in tree form and in graph form for common recursive and dynamic programming procedures. Be sure to run the visualizations for both tabs: one is called "Recursion Tree" and one is called "Recursion DAG (DP)".
* [Recursion playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_aWCzGMAwLz3g66WrxFGSXvSsvyfzCO): Strong programming foundations from mycodeschool, YouTube Channel.
