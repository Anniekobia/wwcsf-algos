## Problem Sets
### Beginner exercises

Goals for beginners:  
1. Learn definitions of upper bound(Big-O), tight bound (Big-Theta), and lower bound(Big-Omega). What kind of bound do we usually mean by the term 'Big-O'? 
2. Given any function, learn how to drop constants and non-dominant terms to obtain a Big-O bound on that function.
3. Practice analyzing loop structures for run-time.

### Intermediate exercises

Goals for intermediate coders:
1. Memorize orders of growth for canonical functions.  
2. Practice analyzing recursive algorithms, be able to compare runtime to an iterative translation.
3. Understand the common run-times with logarithms.
4. Memorize run-times for sorts, searches, traversals, and retrievals for various algorithms and Data Structures.
5. Practice accounting for space used during computation.

### Advanced Exercises
Goals for Advanced coders:
1. Learn about formal methods to solve recurrences, (those you would find in a textbook or university Algorithms class: Subsitution, Iteration, Master Method). 
2. Know various techniques to trade off time for space, such as hash tables, heaps, sorting.
4. Understand amortized analysis and its applications to various data structures.
5. Memorize various patterns that are common run-times, such as a geometric series, arithmetic series.
