# Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a technique that optimizes over recursion, by leveraging the shared solutions and structues of subproblems. Therefore, understanding recursion is a recommended prerequisite to learning about DP. Our resources and practice problems at [Recursion](https://github.com/elaguerta/wwcsf-algos/tree/master/topics/recursion.md) will help you get up to speed.
